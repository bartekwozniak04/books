  "summary": {
    "chapter_1": "Chapter 1 - Never Outshine the Master\nThis law emphasizes the importance of making those above you feel superior.  Avoid flaunting your talents excessively, as this can inspire fear and insecurity in those who hold power over you. Instead, make your masters appear more brilliant than they are, subtly promoting their image while advancing your own.",
    "chapter_2": "Chapter 2 - Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies\nFriends can be more dangerous than enemies, as envy and familiarity can breed betrayal.  Former enemies, on the other hand, have more to prove and can be surprisingly loyal.  If you lack enemies, find a way to create them, for they can serve as a useful tool in the game of power.",
    "chapter_3": "Chapter 3 - Conceal Your Intentions\nKeep your true intentions hidden, shrouding your actions in mystery.  By creating a smokescreen, you prevent others from preparing a defense and can lure them down the wrong path.  When they finally realize your true motives, it will be too late.",
    "chapter_4": "Chapter 4 - Always Say Less Than Necessary\nSpeaking too much can make you appear common and less in control.  Cultivate an air of mystery by saying less than necessary.  Your silence will make others uncomfortable and amplify the impact of your words.",
    "chapter_5": "Chapter 5 - So Much Depends on Reputation: Guard It with Your Life\nReputation is the cornerstone of power.  Cultivate an unassailable reputation, be alert to potential attacks, and learn to destroy your enemies by undermining their reputations. Public opinion is a powerful weapon.",
    "chapter_6": "Chapter 6 - Court Attention at All Cost\nEverything is judged by its appearance. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd.  Stand out. Be conspicuous. Make yourself a magnet of attention by cultivating a larger-than-life image.",
    "chapter_7": "Chapter 7 - Get Others to Do the Work for You, But Always Take the Credit\nUse the wisdom, knowledge, and efforts of others to advance your own cause.  You will gain the credit while your helpers are forgotten.  Never do yourself what others can do for you.",
    "chapter_8": "Chapter 8 - Make Other People Come to You: Use Bait if Necessary\nControl the situation by making others come to you.  Lure them with promises of fabulous gains, then attack.  When you force others to act, you hold the cards.",
    "chapter_9": "Chapter 9 - Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument\nArguments are rarely persuasive and often create lasting resentment.  Win through your actions, not through words.  Demonstrate, do not explicate.",
    "chapter_10": "Chapter 10 - Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky\nMisery and misfortune are contagious.  Associate with the happy and fortunate, and avoid those who draw misfortune on themselves.  Protect yourself from the negativity of others.",
    "chapter_11": "Chapter 11 - Learn to Keep People Dependent on You\nMaintain your independence by making others dependent on you.  The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have.  Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.",
    "chapter_12": "Chapter 12 - Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm Your Victim\nA single act of honesty or generosity can disarm even the most suspicious person.  Use selective honesty to open a hole in their armor, then deceive and manipulate them at will.",
    "chapter_13": "Chapter 13 - When Asking for Help, Appeal to People's Self-Interest\nWhen seeking help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.  Highlight how helping you will benefit them, and they will be more likely to assist you.",
    "chapter_14": "Chapter 14 - Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy\nGather intelligence on your rivals.  Use spies, or better yet, become a spy yourself.  In social encounters, learn to probe for information that will give you an advantage.",
    "chapter_15": "Chapter 15 - Crush Your Enemy Totally\nA feared enemy must be crushed completely.  Leaving even a small ember alight can lead to future problems.  Total annihilation is the only sure way to prevent revenge.",
    "chapter_16": "Chapter 16 - Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor\nToo much presence diminishes value.  Make yourself scarce to increase your respect and honor.  Learn when to leave and create value through absence.",
    "chapter_17": "Chapter 17 - Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability\nHumans crave predictability.  Be deliberately unpredictable to keep others off balance.  Unpredictability can be a powerful tool of intimidation.",
    "chapter_18": "Chapter 18 - Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself: Isolation Is Dangerous\nIsolation is more dangerous than it seems.  It cuts you off from valuable information and makes you an easy target.  Better to circulate among people and find allies.",
    "chapter_19": "Chapter 19 - Know Who You're Dealing With: Do Not Offend the Wrong Person\nNot everyone reacts the same way to your strategies.  Some people are wolves in lambs clothing and will seek revenge if offended.  Choose your victims and opponents carefully.",
    "chapter_20": "Chapter 20 - Do Not Commit to Anyone\nMaintain your independence by refusing to commit to any side or cause but yourself.  By staying neutral, you become the master of others, playing people against one another.",
    "chapter_21": "Chapter 21 - Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker: Seem Dumber Than Your Mark\nMake your victims feel smart, even smarter than you.  Once they are convinced of their superiority, they will never suspect your ulterior motives.",
    "chapter_22": "Chapter 22 - Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power\nWhen you are weaker, never fight for honor's sake; choose surrender instead.  Surrender gives you time to recover and wait for your opponent's power to wane.",
    "chapter_23": "Chapter 23 - Concentrate Your Forces\nConserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point.  Intensity defeats extensity.  Focus on a single, rich mine rather than flitting from one shallow mine to another.",
    "chapter_24": "Chapter 24 - Play the Perfect Courtier\nMaster the art of indirection.  Flatter, yield to superiors, and assert power over others subtly and gracefully.  The laws of courtiership can take you far.",
    "chapter_25": "Chapter 25 - Re-Create Yourself\nDo not accept the roles society foists on you.  Re-create yourself by forging a new identity that commands attention.  Control your image and incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures.",
    "chapter_26": "Chapter 26 - Keep Your Hands Clean\nMaintain a spotless appearance by never being directly involved in dirty work.  Use others as scapegoats and cat's-paws to disguise your involvement and keep your hands clean.",
    "chapter_27": "Chapter 27 - Play on People's Need to Believe: Create a Cultlike Following\nPeople have a deep need to believe in something.  Become the focal point of this need by offering them a cause or a new faith to follow.  Emphasize enthusiasm over rationality.",
    "chapter_28": "Chapter 28 - Enter Action with Boldness\nTimidity is dangerous.  Enter action with boldness.  Mistakes committed through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity.  Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.",
    "chapter_29": "Chapter 29 - Plan All the Way to the End\nThe ending is everything.  Plan all the way to it, taking into account all possible consequences and obstacles.  By planning to the end, you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances.",
    "chapter_30": "Chapter 30 - Make Your Accomplishments Seem Effortless\nConceal the effort and practice behind your actions.  Make your accomplishments seem effortless, as if you could do much more.  Never reveal how hard you work.",
    "chapter_31": "Chapter 31 - Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards You Deal\nGive people the illusion of choice while actually controlling their options.  Force them to choose between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose.",
    "chapter_32": "Chapter 32 - Play to People's Fantasies\nThe truth is often ugly and unpleasant.  Appeal to people's fantasies instead.  Those who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy wield great power.",
    "chapter_33": "Chapter 33 - Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew\nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in their armor.  Find their thumbscrew an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion, or a secret pleasureand use it to your advantage.",
    "chapter_34": "Chapter 34 - Be Royal in Your Own Fashion: Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One\nThe way you carry yourself determines how you are treated.  Act regally and confidently, as if you were destined for greatness, and others will treat you accordingly.",
    "chapter_35": "Chapter 35 - Master the Art of Timing\nNever seem to be in a hurry.  Patience is a weapon and a sign of control.  Become a detective of the right moment, and strike fiercely when the time is ripe.",
    "chapter_36": "Chapter 36 - Disdain Things You Cannot Have: Ignoring Them Is the Best Revenge\nBy acknowledging a petty problem, you give it existence and credibility.  Disdain what you cannot have, and the less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.",
    "chapter_37": "Chapter 37 - Create Compelling Spectacles\nStriking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create an aura of power.  Stage spectacles for those around you, dazzling them with appearances to distract from your true intentions.",
    "chapter_38": "Chapter 38 - Think as You Like But Behave Like Others\nDo not flaunt your unconventional ideas or unorthodox ways.  Blend in and nurture the common touch.  Save your originality for tolerant friends and those who appreciate your uniqueness.",
    "chapter_39": "Chapter 39 - Stir Up Waters to Catch Fish\nAnger and emotion are counterproductive.  Stay calm and objective, but if you can make your enemies angry while remaining calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage.",
    "chapter_40": "Chapter 40 - Despise the Free Lunch\nWhat is offered for free often comes with hidden obligations or strings attached.  By paying your own way, you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit.  Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating.",
    "chapter_41": "Chapter 41 - Avoid Stepping into a Great Man's Shoes\nWhat comes first always appears better and more original than what comes after.  If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, establish your own name and identity by changing course.",
    "chapter_42": "Chapter 42 - Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep Will Scatter\nOften, trouble can be traced to a single strong individual.  Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them.  Strike at the source of the problem and the rest will fall in line.",
    "chapter_43": "Chapter 43 - Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others\nSeduction is more effective than coercion.  Operate on people's individual psychologies and weaknesses to make them want to move in your direction.",
    "chapter_44": "Chapter 44 - Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect\nMirror your enemies to confuse them and make them overreact.  By reflecting their actions back at them, you can disarm them with the illusion of shared values or teach them a lesson.",
    "chapter_45": "Chapter 45 - Preach the Need for Change, But Never Reform Too Much at Once\nPeople are creatures of habit.  Preach the need for change, but implement it gradually.  Too much innovation is traumatic and can lead to revolt.",
    "chapter_46": "Chapter 46 - Never Appear Too Perfect\nAppearing better than others is dangerous.  Displaying occasional flaws and admitting to harmless vices can deflect envy and make you seem more human and approachable.",
    "chapter_47": "Chapter 47 - Do Not Go Past the Mark You Aimed For: In Victory, Learn When to Stop\nThe moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril.  Avoid arrogance and overconfidence.  Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop.",
    "chapter_48": "Chapter 48 - Assume Formlessness\nBy taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack.  Remain adaptable and on the move.  Be as fluid and formless as water, never betting on stability or lasting order."
